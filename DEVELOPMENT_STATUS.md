   - Rate limiting and authentication
   - Metrics and health monitoring

5. **`analytics-service`** - Traffic analytics and metrics collection
   - Real-time event tracking and storage
   - Time-series data with TimescaleDB
   - Performance metrics collection
   - CSV export functionality

### 🐹 **Go Services**

   - Export functionality (CSV/JSON)

4. **`blossom-server`** - File storage service (Premium tier)
   - BUD-01 Blossom protocol implementation
   - MinIO backend for object storage
   - Nostr authentication (NIP-98)
   - File deduplication with SHA256
   - Premium subscription requirement

### ⚛️ **Frontend**
- **Next.js 14** web application setup
- **TypeScript** configuration
- **TailwindCSS** styling
- **Component library** foundation

### 🐳 **Infrastructure**
- **Docker Compose** with all services
- **PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB** for events
- **Redis** for caching and sessions
- **NATS** for message queuing
- **Prometheus + Grafana** for monitoring
- **Jaeger** for distributed tracing

### 📋 **Development Workflow**
- **Comprehensive Makefile** with 30+ commands
- **Environment configuration** with dev/prod settings
- **Health checks** and monitoring setup
- **Testing framework** integration
- **Linting and formatting** automation

## 🚀 **Ready to Start Development**

You can now:

```bash
# Set up the entire development environment
make setup

# Start all services with Docker
make docker-up

# Or run individual services for development
make dev-relay    # Start Rust relay engine
make dev-api      # Start Go API gateway  
make dev-web      # Start Next.js frontend

# Run tests across all services
make test

# Format and lint code
make format lint
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps for Implementation**

### Week 1-2: Core Relay Functionality
1. **Complete relay-engine implementation**
   - WebSocket message handling
   - Event storage and retrieval
   - Subscription management

2. **Database schema implementation**
   - Events table with TimescaleDB
   - Users and subscriptions tables
   - Proper indexing for performance

### Week 3-4: API Services
1. **Complete API gateway handlers**
   - User registration and authentication
   - Subscription management endpoints
   - Relay status and metrics APIs

2. **Billing service implementation**
   - Lightning payment integration
   - Subscription lifecycle management
   - Invoice generation

### Week 5-6: Frontend Development
1. **Core web application**
   - User authentication UI
   - Dashboard with relay metrics
   - Subscription management interface

2. **Integration testing**
   - End-to-end user flows
   - Payment processing tests
   - Performance testing

## 🏛️ **Modular Benefits Achieved**

✅ **Maintainability**: Each service has clear responsibilities
✅ **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently  
✅ **Testability**: Isolated testing of components
✅ **Development Speed**: Teams can work on different services
✅ **Technology Choice**: Best tool for each job (Rust for performance, Go for APIs)
✅ **Deployment Flexibility**: Services can be deployed independently
